#### Brief Description of Project - The project Tire Sales and Service Management System is developing under the guidance of our virtual client Auto Force international (PVT) LTD. 
AutoForce Tire Sales and Service Center is a well-known place for providing their premium service to customers in both tire selling and servicing for more than 20 years. There are different range of tires from different categories which allows customers to select tires as their requirement and, they will be able to get their vehicle service done through AutoForce. Despite the high level of service, they use manual techniques for invoicing, ordering and every other function in their business, making it more difficult to consider documentation, calculations and business judgments. Also, while purchasing a stock of tires, there have been many errors in the management and handling of parts such as loss of relevant documents for the suppliers and they provide false information about the stock available for purchase from the suppliers, which results in loss of money to their business. During the pandemic, AutoForce service center faced many problems due to their manual way of handling tasks. The main problem was that they could not keep their premises open as they did not have an online platform as a backup plan to face such an epidemic situation. Also lack of knowledge to handle a system online and unfamiliarity with technology had led them to keep their business closed during the covid 19 period.  
This project includes all the newest features which are hence useful for both customers and system management. Also, this project gives the opportunity to provide the services continuously even during a pandemic timeline and the system covers all aspects from the buyer to the business owner, suppliers, and employees.
